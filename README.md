# Chess AI
A playable chess AI in Python (needs pygame)

Setup: In chessmain.py, under the run_game function - 

    The default is currently set to two human players, 
    you can change this by setting player 1 (white) or
    player 2 (black) to false to play against an AI instead.

    If you choose to select an AI opponent, you can set the
    difficulty of the AI by choosing one of three options:
    random AI (easy), greedy AI (medium), best AI (hard) by
    setting the one of your choice to true, and the rest to 
    false. The default is the best AI.

Controls:
    
    There is an intuitive feel to the UI, so play as you think
    you should. Press N for a new game, and U to undo a move.
    Note that against the AI opponent, you need to press undo twice
    to undo the AI move. 

Good luck, and have fun!
